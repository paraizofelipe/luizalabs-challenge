# Luizalabs Challenge

This project aims to develop a Rest API for querying products, buyers and managing buyers' favorite products.

# Getting Started

These instructions will provide you a copy of the project that can be run on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Consult deployment item for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

# Prerequisites

This package was created with go1.16 and all you need is the standard go library.

# Variables

To make the application easier to run, the project has a `.env` file to declare the environment variables

- **HOST** - Host address the application will use
- **PORT** - Port number where the application will listen to http requests
- **DEBUG** - Variable to define whether an API will produce logs for stdout
- **SECRET** - Secret word using to decode JWT
- **STORAGE** - Database address

# Installing

This is what you need to install the application from the source code:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/paraizofelipe/luizalabs-challenge
```

To build the docker version you can use the `Makefile`:

```bash
    make dk-build 
```

# Running the tests

Until I finish this README there is not so much Unit tests written.

But I will try to coverage unless 80% of unit tests for this code as soon as possible.

You can run tests like this:

```bash
    make test
```

To run this code locally for test purposes use:

Example:
```bash
    STORAGE=postgres://luiza:labs@localhost:5432/luizalabs?sslmode=disable DEBUG=true HOST=0.0.0.0 SECRET=magalu PORT=3000 make start
```

# Deployment

This codebase is cloud-native by design so you can use lots of environments to make this run anywhere you want.

But to make this even easier to you the codebase also provides a Dockerfile.

Deploy with docker:

```bash
    make dk-deploy
```

# API

## Authorization

The API uses basic authentication with permissions based on read and write. To make testing easier, you can use the following tokens in the request header.
**Note**: These tokes only work with the environment variable `SECRET` set to magalu.
